abstract = {The synthesis of the desired chemical compound is the main task of synthetic organic chemistry. The predictions of reaction conditions and some important quantitative characteristics of chemical reactions as yield and reaction rate can substantially help in the development of optimal synthetic routes and assessment of synthesis cost. Theoretical assessment of these parameters can be performed with the help of modern machine-learning approaches, which use available experimental data to develop predictive models called quantitative or qualitative structure–reactivity relationship (QSRR) modelling. In the article, we review the state-of-the-art in the QSRR area and give our opinion on emerging trends in this field.}

@phdthesis{lowe_extraction_2012,
	type = {Thesis},
	title = {Extraction of chemical structures and reactions from the literature},
	copyright = {All Rights Reserved},
	url = {https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/244727},
	abstract = {The ever increasing quantity of chemical literature necessitates
the creation of automated techniques for extracting relevant information.
This work focuses on two aspects: the conversion of chemical names to
computer readable structure representations and the extraction of chemical
reactions from text.
Chemical names are a common way of communicating chemical structure
information. OPSIN (Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature), an
open source, freely available algorithm for converting chemical names to
structures was developed. OPSIN employs a regular grammar to direct
tokenisation and parsing leading to the generation of an XML parse tree.
Nomenclature operations are applied successively to the tree with many
requiring the manipulation of an in-memory connection table representation
of the structure under construction. Areas of nomenclature supported are
described with attention being drawn to difficulties that may be
encountered in name to structure conversion. Results on sets of generated
names and names extracted from patents are presented. On generated names,
recall of between 96.2\% and 99.0\% was achieved with a lower bound of 97.9\%
on precision with all results either being comparable or superior to the
tested commercial solutions. On the patent names OPSIN s recall was 2-10\%
higher than the tested solutions when the patent names were processed as
found in the patents. The uses of OPSIN as a web service and as a tool for
identifying chemical names in text are shown to demonstrate the direct
utility of this algorithm.
A software system for extracting chemical reactions from the text of
chemical patents was developed. The system relies on the output of
ChemicalTagger, a tool for tagging words and identifying phrases of
importance in experimental chemistry text. Improvements to this tool
required to facilitate this task are documented. The structure of chemical
entities are where possible determined using OPSIN in conjunction with a
dictionary of name to structure relationships. Extracted reactions are
atom mapped to confirm that they are chemically consistent. 424,621 atom
mapped reactions were extracted from 65,034 organic chemistry USPTO
patents. On a sample of 100 of these extracted reactions chemical entities
were identified with 96.4\% recall and 88.9\% precision. Quantities could be
associated with reagents in 98.8\% of cases and 64.9\% of cases for products
whilst the correct role was assigned to chemical entities in 91.8\% of
cases. Qualitatively the system captured the essence of the reaction in
95\% of cases. This system is expected to be useful in the creation of
searchable databases of reactions from chemical patents and in
facilitating analysis of the properties of large populations of reactions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04555},
	abstract = {The prediction of organic reaction outcomes is a fundamental problem in computational chemistry. Since a reaction may involve hundreds of atoms, fully exploring the space of possible transformations is intractable. The current solution utilizes reaction templates to limit the space, but it suffers from coverage and efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a template-free approach to efficiently explore the space of product molecules by first pinpointing the reaction center -- the set of nodes and edges where graph edits occur. Since only a small number of atoms contribute to reaction center, we can directly enumerate candidate products. The generated candidates are scored by a Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network that models high-order interactions between changes occurring at nodes across the molecule. Our framework outperforms the top-performing template-based approach with a 10{\textbackslash}\% margin, while running orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we demonstrate that the model accuracy rivals the performance of domain experts.},
